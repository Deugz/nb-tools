   abstract = {Effective collaboration in data science can leverage domain expertise from each team member and thus improve the quality and efficiency of the work. Computational notebooks give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. In this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. Building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.},

   abstract = {The dramatic increase in the use of knowledge discovery applications requires end users to write complex database search requests to retrieve information. Such users are not only expected to grasp the structural complexity of complex databases but also the semantic relationships between data stored in databases. In order to overcome such difficulties, researchers have been focusing on knowledge representation and interactive query generation through ontologies, with particular emphasis on improving the interface between data and search requests in order to bring the result sets closer to users research requirements. This paper discusses ontology-based information retrieval approaches and techniques by taking into consideration the aspects of ontology modelling, processing and the translation of ontological knowledge into database search requests. It also extensively compares the existing ontology-to-database transformation and mapping approaches in terms of loss of data and semantics, structural mapping and domain knowledge applicability. The research outcomes, recommendations and future challenges presented in this paper can bridge the gap between ontology and relational models to generate precise search requests using ontologies. Moreover, the comparison presented between various ontology-based information retrieval, database-to-ontology transformations and ontology-to-database mappings approaches provides a reference for enhancing the searching capabilities of massively loaded information management systems.},

However, for new practitioners that approach the field, this amount of information might seem overwhelming. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to help in guiding new practitioners get a general idea on the state of the field and to determine possible research lines. To do so, we first perform a literature review of the field in the last decade by means of an online search. The articles retrieved are sorted using a classification framework that we propose, and the different categories are revised and analyzed. The information in this review is extended and supported by the results obtained by a survey that we have designed and conducted among the practitioners.},

@article{DeAlmeida2007,
   abstract = {The term systematic review is used to refer to a specific methodology of research, developed in order to gather and evaluate the available evidence pertaining to a focused topic. It represents a secondary study that depends on primary study results to be accomplished. Several primary studies have been conducted in the field of Software Engineering in the last years, determining an increasing improvement in methodology. However, in most cases software is built with technologies and processes for which developers have insufficient evidence to confirm their suitability, limits, qualities, costs, and inherent risks. Conducting systematic reviews in Software Engineering consists in a major methodological tool to scientifically improve the validity of assertions that can be made in the field and, as a consequence, the reliability degree of the methods that are employed for developing software technologies and supporting software processes. This paper aims at discussing the significance of experimental studies, particularly systematic reviews, and their use in supporting software processes. A template designed to support systematic reviews in Software Engineering is presented, and the development of ontologies to describe knowledge regarding such experimental studies is also introduced. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, standards development is needed to create an infrastructure capable of representing the diverse nature of scientific data. This paper describes a fundamental data model for scientific data that can be applied to data currently stored in any format, and an associated ontology that affords semantic representation of the structure of scientific data (and its metadata), upon which discipline specific semantics can be applied. Application of this data model to experimental and computational chemistry data are presented, implemented using JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data.

   abstract = {Philosophers frequently struggle with the relation of metaphysics to the everyday world, with its practical value, and with its relation to empirical science. This paper distinguishes several different models of the relation between philosophical ontology and applied (scientific) ontology that have been advanced in the history of philosopy. Adoption of a strong participation model for the philosophical ontologist in science is urged, and requirements and consequences of the participation model are explored. This approach provides both a principled view and justification of the role of the philosophical ontologist in contemporary empirical science as well as guidelines for integrating philosophers and philosophical contributions into the practice of science. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},
